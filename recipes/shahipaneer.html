            <dd>
                <ol>
                    <li>Saute jeera, whole spices and green chillies in hot oil in a pan for a minute or two till fragrant. The jeera should start spluttering.

                        <li>Add onions and ginger garlic paste and saute for 2-3 minutes</li>
                        
                        <li>Add tomatoes, cashew nuts and water and simmer covered for 7-8 minutes</li>
                        
                        <li>Remove the bayleaf and big cardamom and let this mixture cool completely</li>
                        <li>Once the mixture is completely cool, pour this into a blender, mixer grinder or food processor</li>
                        <li>Blend till smooth</li>
                        <li>Heat ghee and butter in a pan and add sugar. Cook the sugar till it starts to caramelise and turns light golden brown</li>
                        <li>Add ground spices and saute on low for a minute. Be careful not to burn the spices. You can add a splash of water to cool the pan slightly so the spices cook but don't burn</li>
                        <li>Pour the onion, tomato and cashew mixture into the pan</li>
                        <li>Simmer covered for 10 minutes till you see some oil floating to the top</li>
                        <li>Add paneer and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Don't overcook the paneer or it'll start to get rubbery</li>
                        <li>Add roasted kasuri methi and cream and mix well. Turn off the flame, top with fresh coriander and another dash of cream and serve hot</li>
